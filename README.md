When I worked on a project using MATLAB I came across various practical little things that helped me analyse my work/data

## general Tipps:
1. save your data in a struct to avoid repetative variable names ([MATLAB Struct](https://www.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/struct.html))
* `data.input` and `data.output` instead of `input` and `output` --> your Workspace will then save only `data` and you can avoid multiple variable filling up your workspace column
2. use variable names consistently: [MATLAB Style GuideBook](github.com/useful_matlab_tipps_for_beginners/docs)
